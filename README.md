# fdac

Python code for the frequency domain activity correction (fdac). The method consists of developing a stellar activiy model from in the frequency domain of activity indicators to then fit the Fourier transform of the radial velocity. Once fitted in the frequcny domain the activity model is transformed into the time domain to obtain as residual time series.
