# fdac

The frequency domain activity correction (fdac) package consists of developing stellar activiy model in the frequency domain by the Fourier transform of the radial velocity using the activity indicators as explanatory variables. Once fitted in the frequcny domain the activity model is transformed into the time domain to obtain as residual time series.

This is a current work in progress, so an feedback will eb greatly appreciated!
